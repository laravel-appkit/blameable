This package allows you to store the creator (`created_by`) and last editor (`edited_by`) of an Eloquent Model. You can also store the user who soft deleted a model.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require laravel-appkit/blameable
```

## Usage

First, add the `created_at`, `updated_at` (and optionally `deleted_at`) columns to your table. This can be done via the `blameable` method in your migration.

```php
Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->increments('id');
    $table->string('title');
    $table->text('body');
    $table->timestamps();

    // add this line to create the columns
    $table->blameable(); // pass in true as the first argument to enable soft deletes columns
});
```

Next, add the `AppKit\Blameable\Traits\Blameable` trait to the model

``` php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use AppKit\Blameable\Traits\Blameable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Article extends Model
{
    use Blameable;

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'body'
    ];
}
```

The id of the user can be accessed via the `created_at`, `updated_at` and `deleted_at` attributes on the model.

Relationships have also been setup to fetch an instance of the user model

```php
$article = Article::first();

$article->creator // the user model that created the article
$article->editor // the user model that last updated the article
$article->deleter // the user model that soft deleted the article
```

### Testing

composer test
```
